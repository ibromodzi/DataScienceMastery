# Module II: Numerical Analysis with NumPy and Data Manipulation with Pandas

Welcome to Module II of the Data Science Mastery curriculum! In this module, we'll dive deep into two essential aspects of data science: Numerical Analysis using NumPy and Data Manipulation using Pandas.

## Overview

- **Module 2.1: Numerical Analysis with NumPy** 
  - Learn how to perform efficient numerical computations in Python using the powerful NumPy library. Explore arrays, mathematical operations, and tools for working with data.

- **Module 2.2: Data Manipulation with Pandas** 
  - Discover the versatile Pandas library, your go-to tool for data wrangling. Explore data structures like DataFrames and Series, data cleaning, transformation, and manipulation techniques.
