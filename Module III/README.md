# Module III: Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn

Welcome to Module III of the Data Science Mastery curriculum! In this module, we'll explore the exciting world of data visualization using two powerful libraries: Matplotlib and Seaborn. Visualization is a crucial skill for data scientists, enabling us to tell compelling stories and gain insights from data.

## Overview

This module includes the following resources:

- **Data Visualization with Matplotlib.ipynb**
  - Learn how to create various types of plots using Matplotlib, such as line charts, histograms, bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots.

- **Data Visualization with Seaborn.ipynb**
  - Dive into data visualization with Seaborn, a high-level interface for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics.

- **stock_data.csv**
  - Sample dataset for practicing data visualization.

- **titanic.csv**
  - Titanic dataset for real-world data visualization exercises.

- **world_happiness.csv**
  - Another dataset for exploring data visualization concepts.

## What You'll Learn

- Create a wide range of data visualizations using Matplotlib.
- Utilize Seaborn for more advanced and aesthetically pleasing visualizations.
- Interpret and draw insights from visual representations of data.
- Apply data visualization techniques to real-world datasets.

## Getting Started

To begin your data visualization journey in this module:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the Jupyter notebooks `Data Visualization with Matplotlib.ipynb` and `Data Visualization with Seaborn.ipynb` to learn about creating various types of plots.
3. Use the provided datasets (`stock_data.csv`, `titanic.csv`, and `world_happiness.csv`) for hands-on practice.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.

This module will equip you with the skills to effectively communicate data-driven insights through visualizations. By the end of Module III, you'll be proficient in using Matplotlib and Seaborn to create compelling visualizations that enhance your data science projects.

Happy learning!
