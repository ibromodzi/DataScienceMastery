Python is a general purpose, high level programming language that was developed by Guido van Rossum in the late 1980s.

Like all high level programming languages, Python code resembles the English language which computers are unable to understand. 


For the computer to understand the codes, it has to be interpreted by a special piece of software known as interpreter which must be installed before we can code, text and execute our python programs.
