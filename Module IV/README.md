# Module IV: Statistics Fundamentals

Welcome to Module IV of the Data Science Mastery curriculum! In this module, we'll dive into the fundamentals of statistics, a critical component of data science. You'll gain the knowledge and skills needed to analyze and interpret data effectively.

## Overview

This module is divided into three parts:

- **StatisticsFundamentals I.ipynb**
  - Introduction to basic statistical concepts.
  - Understanding data distributions and measures of central tendency.
  - Exploring data variability and spread.

- **StatisticsFundamentals II.ipynb**
  - Dive deeper into statistics.
  - Learn about probability distributions and sampling.
  - Hypothesis testing and p-values.

- **StatisticsFundamentals III.ipynb**
  - Explore advanced statistical topics.
  - Confidence intervals and hypothesis testing.
  - Practical applications of statistics in data science.

## What You'll Learn

- Essential statistical concepts and terminology.
- Analyzing and interpreting data distributions.
- Making informed decisions through hypothesis testing.
- Practical applications of statistics in data science.

## Getting Started

To begin your learning journey in this module:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific notebook (StatisticsFundamentals I, II, or III) you'd like to explore.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook (*.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
4. Follow along with the provided examples, exercises, and assignments.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming.
- Familiarity with Module II (Numerical Analysis with NumPy) is recommended.

This module is designed to equip you with a solid foundation in statistics, a key skill for any data scientist. By the end of Module IV, you'll have the knowledge and tools to perform statistical analysis on data and draw meaningful insights.

Happy learning!
